# PassionFruit
TLDR; Random Passion Projects! 

**Background** 

Inspiried by the New York Culture, we decided that its time to stop being plain Janes stuck in our 9-5 jobs. 'Cause when opportunities don't come knocking your way, you create them.  

This is our quest to try to find ways in which we can practice our *embrassingly limited "tech skills"*, applied in projects that we think is fun/ interesting. We might not be the ones destined to save the world with our tech skills, but we can save ourselves from our boredom. 

**Organization of this Repo**

Two main folders, for two of the current contributors- Sherms and QY. Click on each folder to explore the passion projects done by each individual respectively.
