# WGS84's attempt for [Data Arcade Tournament 2021](https://sites.google.com/dsaid.gov.sg/dat2021)

DAT is an annual visual analytics competition exercise for officers serving in the Singapore Public service. This is our submission for #DAT2021! 

The theme for this year's tournament is "Before & After". Before diving into our project proper, would like to warmly welcome Shan Yi into our group this year! Together we form the merry trio of Wong-Goh-See, so we named our group after a famous geographic coordinate system WGS84 :) 

## Our Chosen Topic: All about that Double Digit Day Sales Hype

As frequent and at times, irrational online shoppers, we decided that it would be fun to try to answer a nagging question everytime we get bombared with yet another monthly Double Digit Day Sales Advertisement:

**"Are Double Digit Day Sales really worth it? Am I getting good value in such sales?"** 

We set about answering the loaded question above by analyzing the sales before and after the Double Digit Day Sale. As a wise anonynmous person once said: "If you don't know the difference between past and present, you will not understand the future". Our take of the theme will include analysis for "Before the Double Digit Day Sale", "During the Double Digit Day Sale" and "After the Double Digit Day Sale". 

For the purposes of this competition, we have narrowed down the topic to cover the following: 
- Shopee Double Digit Day Flash Sales on 8/9/2021 (before), 9/9/2021 (during) and 10/9/2021 (after)
