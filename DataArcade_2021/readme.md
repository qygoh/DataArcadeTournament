# PassionFruit's attempt for [Data Arcade Tournament 2021](https://sites.google.com/dsaid.gov.sg/dat2021)

DAT is an annual visual analytics competition exercise for officers serving in the Singapore Public service. This is our submission for #DAT2021! 

The theme for this year's tournament is "Before & After". Before diving into our project proper, would like to warmly welcome Shan Yi into our group this year! Together we form the merry trio of Wong-Goh-See, so we named our group after a famous geographic coordinate WGS84 :)
